# Entorns Grafics i Realitat Augmentada
## *Computer graphics and augmented reality*

---

In this 4 month project, we have developed a racing simulator programmed in Python whose main objectives are to provide an alternative with a high level of graphic detail, interactivity with the user and a physics engine that provides realism. In addition, our simulator has the ability to generate new tracks completely randomly and has integrated a machine learning model to drive autonomously in different possible scenarios. This positions us as a robust multi-objective simulator that allows the interactivity of being used as a video game or as a powerful simulator for training and evaluation of learning models reinforced by its ability to display racing performance metrics.
